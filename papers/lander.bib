abstract = {Vision algorithms face challenges of limited visual presentation and unreliability in pedestrian activity assessment. In this article, we introduce LANDER, an interactive analysis system for visual exploration of pedestrian activity and uncertainty in surveillance videos. This visual analytics system focuses on three common categories of uncertainties in object tracking and action recognition. LANDER offers an overview visualization of activity and uncertainty, along with spatio-temporal exploration views closely associated with the scene. Expert evaluation and user study indicate that LANDER outperforms traditional video exploration in data presentation and analysis workflow. Specifically, compared to the baseline method, it excels in reducing retrieval time (p< 0.01), enhancing uncertainty identification (p< 0.05), and improving the user experience (p< 0.05).},
